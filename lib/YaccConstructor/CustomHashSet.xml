            ABOUT:
            Helps with operations that rely on bit marking to indicate whether an item in the 
            collection should be added, removed, visited already, etc. 
            
            BitHelper doesn't allocate the array; you must pass in an array or ints allocated on the 
            stack or heap. ToIntArrayLength() tells you the int array size you must allocate. 
            
            USAGE:
            Suppose you need to represent a bit array of length (i.e. logical bit array length)
            BIT_ARRAY_LENGTH. Then this is the suggested way to instantiate BitHelper:
            ***************************************************************************
            int intArrayLength = BitHelper.ToIntArrayLength(BIT_ARRAY_LENGTH);
            BitHelper bitHelper;
            if (intArrayLength less than stack alloc threshold)
                int* m_arrayPtr = stackalloc int[intArrayLength];
                bitHelper = new BitHelper(m_arrayPtr, intArrayLength);
            else
                int[] m_arrayPtr = new int[intArrayLength];
                bitHelper = new BitHelper(m_arrayPtr, intArrayLength);
            ***************************************************************************
            
            IMPORTANT:
            The second ctor args, length, should be specified as the length of the int array, not
            the logical bit array. Because length is used for bounds checking into the int array,
            it's especially important to get this correct for the stackalloc version. See the code 
            samples above; this is the value gotten from ToIntArrayLength(). 
            
            The length ctor argument is the only exception; for other methods -- MarkBit and 
            IsMarked -- pass in values as indices into the logical bit array, and it will be mapped
            to the position within the array of ints.
            
            FUTURE OPTIMIZATIONS:
            A method such as FindFirstMarked/Unmarked Bit would be useful for callers that operate 
            on a bit array and then need to loop over it. In particular, if it avoided visiting 
            every bit, it would allow good perf improvements when the bit array is sparse.

            if other is a set, we can assume it doesn't have duplicate elements, so use this
            technique: if can't remove, then it wasn't present in this set, so add.
            
            As with other methods, callers take care of ensuring that other is a hashset using the
            same equality comparer.

             <summary>
             Implementation notes:
             
             Used for symmetric except when other isn't a HashSet. This is more tedious because 
             other may contain duplicates. HashSet technique could fail in these situations:
             1. Other has a duplicate that's not in this: HashSet technique would add then 
             remove it.
             2. Other has a duplicate that's in this: HashSet technique would remove then add it
             back.
             In general, its presence would be toggled each time it appears in other. 
             
             This technique uses bit marking to indicate whether to add/remove the item. If already
             present in collection, it will get marked for deletion. If added from other, it will
             get marked as something not to remove.

            is used by SymmetricExcept because it needs to know the following things:
            - whether the item was already present in the collection or added from other
            - where it's located (if already present, it will get marked for removal, otherwise

            <summary>
            Determines counts that can be used to determine equality, subset, and superset. This
            is only used when other is an IEnumerable and not a HashSet. If other is a HashSet
            these properties can be checked faster without use of marking because we can assume 
            other has no duplicates.
            
            The following count checks are performed by callers:
            1. Equals: checks if unfoundCount = 0 and uniqueFoundCount = _count; i.e. everything 
            in other is in this and everything in this is in other
            2. Subset: checks if unfoundCount >= 0 and uniqueFoundCount = _count; i.e. other may
            have elements not in this and everything in this is in other
            3. Proper subset: checks if unfoundCount > 0 and uniqueFoundCount = _count; i.e
            other must have at least one element not in this and everything in this is in other
            4. Proper superset: checks if unfound count = 0 and uniqueFoundCount strictly less
            than _count; i.e. everything in other was in this and this had at least one element
            not contained in other.
            
            An earlier implementation used delegates to perform these checks rather than returning
            an ElementCount struct; however this was changed due to the perf overhead of delegates.
